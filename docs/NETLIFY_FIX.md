# âœ… Netlify Deployment - READY TO DEPLOY

## ðŸŽ¯ What We Fixed

The build error was caused by **Turbopack** (Next.js 16's experimental bundler) having path resolution issues.

### Solution Applied:
- âœ… Updated build command to use **webpack** (stable, production-ready)
- âœ… Added `build:webpack` script to package.json
- âœ… Configured netlify.toml to use the webpack build
- âœ… Committed and pushed all changes to GitHub

---

## ðŸš€ Deploy Now

### 1. Trigger New Build in Netlify

Go to your Netlify site dashboard and click **"Trigger deploy"** â†’ **"Clear cache and deploy site"**

Or Netlify will auto-deploy since you just pushed to `main` branch.

### 2. Expected Build Output

You should now see:

```bash
âœ“ Building with webpack (stable bundler)
âœ“ Compiled successfully
âœ“ Linting and checking validity of types  
âœ“ Collecting page data
âœ“ Generating static pages
âœ“ Build complete!
```

### 3. If Build Still Fails

Check these in order:

**A) Environment Variables Set?**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY  
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN
```

**B) Clear Netlify Cache**
- Netlify Dashboard â†’ Deploys â†’ Trigger deploy â†’ Clear cache and deploy site

**C) Check Build Logs**
- Look for the actual error message
- Most common: Missing environment variable

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Reference

### Netlify Settings (Auto-configured from netlify.toml):
```
Base directory: web
Build command: npm ci && npm run build:webpack
Publish directory: web/.next
Node version: 20
```

### Required Environment Variables:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://lqiglujleojwkcwfbxmr.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<get from Supabase dashboard>
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=<get from mapbox.com - free>
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-site.netlify.app
```

### Get Supabase Anon Key:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lqiglujleojwkcwfbxmr/settings/api
2. Copy the **"anon public"** key (NOT service_role)
3. Paste into Netlify environment variables

### Get Mapbox Token:
1. Sign up: https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/
2. Create a token with default scopes
3. Copy the token starting with `pk.`
4. Paste into Netlify environment variables

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Checklist

After deployment:

- [ ] Build completes successfully (green checkmark)
- [ ] Site URL works (e.g., `https://permitiq-xyz.netlify.app`)
- [ ] Homepage loads with PermitIQ branding
- [ ] No errors in browser console (press F12)
- [ ] Navigation links work (Dashboard, Map View)

---

## ðŸ”„ Future Deployments

Every time you push to `main`, Netlify will automatically:

1. Pull latest code from GitHub
2. Run `npm ci && npm run build:webpack`
3. Deploy to production
4. Update your site URL

**No manual steps needed!** ðŸš€

## ðŸ’¡ Why Webpack Instead of Turbopack?

- **Turbopack**: Next.js 16's new experimental bundler (very fast, but has bugs)
- **Webpack**: Battle-tested, stable bundler (slightly slower, but reliable)

For **development** (local):
```bash
npm run dev  # Uses Turbopack (fast hot reload)
```

For **production** (Netlify):
```bash
npm run build:webpack  # Uses Webpack (stable builds)
```

## ðŸ“Š Build Performance

**Expected build times:**

- First build: 2-3 minutes (downloads dependencies)
- Subsequent builds: 1-2 minutes (uses cache)
- With cache cleared: 2-3 minutes

---

**Status**: âœ… Ready to deploy!  
**Next Action**: Trigger new build in Netlify or wait for auto-deploy  
**ETA**: Site should be live in 2-3 minutes
